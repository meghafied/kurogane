# Recipes

This document covers common workflows and advanced usage patterns when building applications with Kurogane.

## Choosing a frontend source

### Development server

Use a local development server during development.

```rust
use kurogane::App;

fn main() {
    App::url("http://localhost:5173").run_or_exit();
}
```

Works with Vite, React, Vue, Svelte and any HTTP server.

Generate a starter project (see [templates](templates.md) for git-hosted template references):

```bash
kurogane new my-app
```

To wrap an existing frontend project instead, run `kurogane init` inside it.

### Production assets

Load a bundled frontend directly from disk.

```rust
use kurogane::App;

fn main() {
    App::new("dist").run_or_exit();
}
```

Assets are served through the `app://app/` protocol.

### Switching between development and production

```rust
use kurogane::App;

fn main() {
    let app = if cfg!(debug_assertions) { // or anything
        App::url("http://localhost:5173")
    } else {
        App::new("dist")
    };

    app.run_or_exit();
}
```

## Loading WebAssembly modules

Kurogane can serve raw WebAssembly modules through the application protocol.

This allows you to move performance-critical logic into WebAssembly without requiring additional tooling.

### Key capabilities

* Load `.wasm` via the `app://app/` scheme
* Direct JS <-> WASM interop
* No dependency on `wasm-bindgen` or any Rust tooling baked into the runtime

### Build a module

```bash
rustc \
  --target wasm32-unknown-unknown \
  -O \
  --crate-type=cdylib \
  demo.rs \
  -o demo.wasm
```

### Required target

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Place the compiled `.wasm` alongside your frontend:

```text
dist/
├── index.html
└── demo.wasm
```

Then load it using `fetch()` or `WebAssembly.instantiate`.

### Notes

* Only the compiled `.wasm` is required at runtime
* Source files are not needed in production
* You are free to use higher-level tooling if desired

## Creating additional windows

Additional browser windows can be created after startup.

```rust
runtime
    .create_window(kurogane::WindowOptions {
        url: "https://github.com".into(),
        bounds: kurogane::BrowserBounds {
            x: 100,
            y: 100,
            width: 800,
            height: 600,
        },
        show_state: kurogane::WindowState::Normal,
    })
    .expect("failed to create window");
```

### Multiple windows

```rust
let runtime = kurogane::App::url("https://xkcd.com")
    .start()
    .expect("Kurogane failed to initialize");

runtime.create_window(/* ... */)?;
runtime.create_window(/* ... */)?;
```

Each browser runs as a native top-level window.

Only the application creates windows. Chrome's own window and tab commands (Ctrl+N, Ctrl+T, "Open link in new tab") do nothing in a Kurogane window.

See:

* [examples/multi_window.rs](../tests/multi-window.rs)

## One instance per profile

Your app keeps its settings and browsing data between launches. Starting the app again while it is already open brings the existing app window to the front instead of opening another one.

This is useful for things like opening a file or link in an app that is already running. For example, a user might double-click a file, choose your app from **Open With**, click a `myapp://` link, or run:

```text
myapp notes.txt
```

In these cases, Kurogane sends the new launch to the copy that is already running. `App::on_second_instance` lets your app decide what to do with it.

A common use is to open the file or link in the existing window:

```rust
App::new("dist")
    .on_second_instance(|launch, app| {
        for arg in launch.args() {
            // Relative to where the new launch started.
            let path = match launch.working_dir() {
                Some(dir) => dir.join(arg),
                None => arg.into(),
            };

            app.broadcast_json("open-file", &path);
        }
    })
    .run_or_exit();
```

```javascript
kurogane.on("open-file", (json) => openFile(JSON.parse(json)));
```

The hook is only about **another launch of the app**. Opening another window from your own code is separate; your app can create as many windows as it needs without going through `on_second_instance`.

You do not have to handle a second launch. By default, starting the app again simply brings the existing windows to the front.

`launch.switch("new-window")` can be used to check for a switch such as `--new-window`.

On macOS, opening the app bundle while it is already running activates the existing app directly, without starting another process. The hook therefore runs for launches that actually start a new process, such as launching the executable from a terminal.

Sometimes two copies really do need to run at the same time. Give each one a different profile with `App::profile_id`.

## Keeping Chromium quiet

Chrome-style CEF runs browser services that contact Google on their own,
even when your page makes no requests: AI-mode eligibility checks and
search-engine preconnects (`www.google.com`), network time queries
(`clients2.google.com`), component update checks
(`update.googleapis.com`), Safe Browsing list updates
(`safebrowsing.googleapis.com`) and account reconciliation
(`accounts.google.com`).
For apps that promise to stay offline:

```rust
kurogane::App::new("dist").quiet_network(true).run_or_exit();
```

Requests your page makes are unaffected. Safe Browsing is turned off
entirely, so pages loaded from the web get no phishing or malware warnings;
use this for apps that show their own content. Account reconciliation is not
silenced yet: it stops only when sign-in is disallowed, which CEF 150
cannot start with. To check, run with `--log-net-log=/tmp/net.json`, leave
the app idle for at least five minutes (component update checks start
about a minute after launch, Safe Browsing updates a few minutes later),
quit, and look for hosts you did not expect.

See:

* [examples/quiet](../kurogane-suite/scenarios/quiet/main.rs)

## Exposing Rust commands to JavaScript

Register commands using `App::command`.

```rust
use serde_json::json;

let runtime = App::url("https://example.com")
    .command("ping", |payload| {
        Ok(json!({"ok": true, "echo": payload}))
    })
    .start()?;
```

Invoke them from JavaScript:

```javascript
const result = await window.core.invoke("ping", { message: "hello" });
```

Commands exchange JSON values between JavaScript and Rust.

See:

* [examples/ipc.rs](../tests/ipc.rs)

## Adding Chromium flags

Pass Chromium command-line flags during startup.

```rust
use kurogane::App;

fn main() {
    App::new("frontend")
        .chromium_flag("disable-popup-blocking")
        .run_or_exit();
}
```

Flags with values:

```rust
use kurogane::App;

fn main() {
    App::new("frontend")
        .chromium_flag_with_value("enable-blink-features", "CanvasDrawElement")
        .run_or_exit();
}
```

Useful for enabling Chromium features, diagnostics and experimental functionality.

Examples:

* [examples/popups.rs](../tests/popups.rs)
* [examples/css-to-shader.rs](../tests/css-to-shader.rs)

## GPU mode selection

Control how Chromium performs rendering.

### Automatic (default)

```rust
use kurogane::{App, GpuMode};

fn main() {
    App::new("frontend")
        .gpu_mode(GpuMode::Auto)
        .run_or_exit();
}
```

Kurogane automatically selects an appropriate backend for the current environment.

### Hardware acceleration

```rust
use kurogane::{App, GpuMode};

fn main() {
    App::new("frontend")
        .gpu_mode(GpuMode::Hardware)
        .run_or_exit();
}
```

Forces GPU acceleration.

### Software rendering

```rust
use kurogane::{App, GpuMode};

fn main() {
    App::new("frontend")
        .gpu_mode(GpuMode::Software)
        .run_or_exit();
}
```

Useful for:

* Virtual machines
* CI environments
* Remote desktop sessions

### Disable GPU acceleration

```rust
use kurogane::{App, GpuMode};

fn main() {
    App::new("frontend")
        .gpu_mode(GpuMode::Disabled)
        .run_or_exit();
}
```

Disables GPU compositing and hardware acceleration.

## Credential storage

Control how Chromium protects cookies and saved passwords at rest.

### Platform credential store (default)

```rust
use kurogane::{App, CredentialStorage};

fn main() {
    App::new("frontend")
        .credential_storage(CredentialStorage::System)
        .run_or_exit();
}
```

Encryption keys are held by the Keychain on macOS, kwallet or gnome-keyring on
Linux and DPAPI on Windows.

Reaching those stores is not always possible. Access is granted to a specific code identity, so an unsigned macOS binary is re-authorized on every rebuild and raises a Keychain prompt each run.

Hosts with no keyring daemon have nothing to reach at all.

### Built-in store

```rust
use kurogane::{App, CredentialStorage};

fn main() {
    App::new("frontend")
        .credential_storage(CredentialStorage::Basic)
        .run_or_exit();
}
```

Chromium falls back to a fixed built-in key, which is obfuscation rather than encryption. Anything the process can read is readable by anyone with access to the profile directory.

Useful for:

* Unsigned development builds
* Containers and CI environments
* Headless hosts with no keyring daemon

Not suited to profiles holding data worth protecting.

## Custom runtime integration

Use `start()` when integrating Kurogane into an existing event loop or application runtime.

```rust
use std::time::Duration;

use kurogane::App;

fn main() {
    let runtime = App::url("https://example.com")
        .start()
        .expect("Kurogane failed to initialize");

    while !runtime.should_shutdown() {
        runtime.pump();
        std::thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(16));
    }

    runtime.shutdown();
}
```

Useful for:

* Custom event loops
* Game engines
* Framework integrations

See:

* [examples/pump.rs](../tests/pump.rs)

## Advanced: Integrating with winit

Kurogane supports multiple integration strategies for `winit`, including:

* Polling
* Fixed-interval pumping
* Scheduler-driven pumping
* Native embedding

For detailed examples and guidance, see:

* [docs/winit.md](winit.md)

## Advanced: Browser delegates

Browser delegates expose browser-process lifecycle hooks.

```rust
use cef::*;
use kurogane::App;

struct BrowserDelegate;

impl kurogane::ClientAppBrowserDelegate for BrowserDelegate {
    fn on_context_initialized(&self) {
        println!("browser context initialized");
    }
}

fn main() {
    App::url("https://example.com")
        .delegate(BrowserDelegate)
        .run_or_exit();
}
```

Useful for:

* browser process initialization
* Chromium integration
* diagnostics and logging

See:

* [examples/delegates.rs](../tests/delegates.rs)

## Advanced: Renderer delegates

Renderer delegates expose renderer-process lifecycle hooks.

```rust
use cef::*;
use kurogane::App;

struct RendererDelegate;

impl kurogane::ClientAppRendererDelegate for RendererDelegate {
    fn on_context_created(
        &self,
        _browser: Option<&Browser>,
        _frame: Option<&Frame>,
        _context: Option<&V8Context>,
    ) {
        println!("context created");
    }
}

fn main() {
    App::url("https://example.com")
        .renderer_delegate(RendererDelegate)
        .run_or_exit();
}
```

Useful for:

* JavaScript injection
* V8 integration
* renderer diagnostics
* custom renderer behavior

See:

* [examples/delegates.rs](../tests/delegates.rs)
