# Bundling

End-to-end guide for packaging Kurogane applications into distributable bundles.

## Overview

Kurogane's bundler takes your compiled binary, Chromium runtime and frontend assets and produces a self-contained distributable. The process is:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["Build<br/><span style='font-size:12px'>Application binary</span>"]
    B["Resolve Chromium<br/><span style='font-size:12px'>Verified distribution</span>"]
    C["Materialize<br/><span style='font-size:12px'>Runnable runtime</span>"]
    D["Validate<br/><span style='font-size:12px'>Bundle checks</span>"]
    E["Package<br/><span style='font-size:12px'>Canonical bundle</span>"]
    F["Verify<br/><span style='font-size:12px'>Release build</span>"]

    A --> B --> C --> D --> E --> F
```

All three output formats share the same input: a [`ResolvedDistribution`](https://github.com/0x48piraj/kurogane/blob/2caa063cf8cd32352a57f5691417750b2bf3bc2d/kurogane-layout/src/distribution.rs#L36) that captures *what* goes into the bundle, plus the same canonical directory layout produced by [`package_directory()`](https://github.com/0x48piraj/kurogane/blob/2caa063cf8cd32352a57f5691417750b2bf3bc2d/kurogane-layout/src/package.rs#L21).

### Available formats

| Format | Flag | Platform |
|--------|------|----------|
| Directory | `--format dir` | Linux, Windows |
| AppImage | `--format appimage` | Linux only |
| NSIS | `--format nsis` | Windows only |

All formats start from the same verified bundle. The format-specific backends only wrap that bundle for distribution.

```

## Prerequisites

### Required

- **Rust** (stable, with `cargo`)
- **Chromium runtime** installed via `kurogane install` (see [Chromium resolution](#chromium-resolution))

### Optional

- **Frontend assets:** If your project has a built frontend, Kurogane will include the contents of `frontend/dist/`. You can omit this directory for applications without a frontend.
- **NSIS:** Windows bundles created with `--format nsis` require NSIS. Install it from [nsis.sourceforge.io](https://nsis.sourceforge.io), or set `NSIS_PATH` to your `makensis.exe`.
- **Code signing:** Signing requires either `osslsigncode` or `signtool.exe`. See [Code signing](#code-signing) for configuration details.

> [!NOTE]
> You do not need to understand the bundling internals to use `kurogane bundle`. Pick a format, run the command and Kurogane handles the rest. The sections below go into the mechanics for contributors and anyone debugging or extending the bundler.
>
> For the quick path, see [Quick start](#quick-start). If something goes wrong, jump straight to [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

> [!TIP]
> For most projects, bundling is just:
>
> ```bash
> kurogane bundle
> ```
>
> Use `--format appimage` or `--format nsis` when you need a specific distribution format.

## Chromium resolution

The bundler resolves the CEF distribution with an override-first policy:

1. **`CEF_PATH` override**: Accepted **only** when the directory contains an `archive.json` provenance file whose recorded version and platform match the build. An unverifiable or mismatched override is rejected rather than silently packaged. A set-but-broken `CEF_PATH` is a hard error, never a silent fallback.
2. **Managed installation**: `~/.local/share/kurogane/cef/<version>/`, populated by `kurogane install`. Subjected to the same version/platform/provenance verification as overrides.

Chromium resolution prefers `CEF_PATH` when it is set, but an invalid override is an error rather than a fallback. Otherwise Kurogane uses the managed installation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Release bundles require a verifiable Chromium distribution. A local CEF checkout without `archive.json` will not be packaged.

The strictness is deliberate: release artifacts must be traceable to an official Chromium distribution. A bare developer checkout (e.g. a locally built CEF tree) has no provenance record and cannot be shipped by accident, regardless of where it comes from.

    class E,H,K,N failure;
```

### Provenance

`kurogane install` writes `archive.json` next to every managed installation:

```json
{
  "type": "minimal",
  "name": "cef_binary_150.0.10+g8042e43+chromium-150.0.7871.101_linux64_minimal.tar.bz2",
  "sha1": "..."
}
```

An override passes verification when:

* **The Chromium version** matches the expected version exactly, or includes a `+g<hash>` suffix (for example, expected `150.0.10` matches `150.0.10+g8042e43`).
* **The platform name** matches the current target.

### Resolution errors

| Error | Meaning | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| `NotFound` | No managed install for the expected version and no `CEF_PATH` override | Run `kurogane install` |
| `OverrideMissing` | `CEF_PATH` points to a nonexistent path | Correct the variable |
| `UnverifiableOverride` | `CEF_PATH` has no `archive.json` | Use a managed install or an official distribution |
| `UnverifiableManaged` | Managed installation has no `archive.json` | Re-run `kurogane install` |
| `VersionMismatch` | Resolved Chromium version differs from the build's Chromium | Install the matching version |
| `PlatformMismatch` | Resolved Chromium was built for another platform | Install the matching platform archive |

## Runtime materialization

A resolved distribution is not copied into the bundle as-is. Kurogane first materializes a flat, runnable runtime into a per-version cache inside the Cargo target directory:

```
<target-dir>/kurogane/cef-runtime/<full-version>/
```

(e.g. `target/kurogane/cef-runtime/150.0.10+g8042e43/`). The cache is reused when it passes validation and rebuilt otherwise.

Materialization accepts either distribution shape (raw official archives with `Release/` + `Resources/`, or already-flattened trees) and excludes, by construction:

- **Development material**: `include/`, `cmake/`, `libcef_dll/`, `CMakeLists.txt`, `CREDITS.html`
- **Download-cache residue**: `archive.json`, the original `*.tar.bz2` archive

Everything else required at runtime is kept verbatim.

## Quick start

```bash
# One-time: install the Chromium runtime
kurogane install

# Bundle (directory format by default)
kurogane bundle

# Output: dist/
```

### AppImage (Linux single-file)

```bash
kurogane bundle --format appimage

# Output: dist/myapp_1.0.0_x86_64.AppImage
```

### Windows installer

```powershell
kurogane bundle --format nsis

# Output: dist/myapp_1.0.0_x64-setup.exe
```

## Command reference

```
kurogane bundle [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --format <FORMAT>          Output format: dir, appimage, nsis [default: dir]
  --debug                    Bundle debug build instead of release
  --sign                     Sign bundle binaries and the final artifact using
                             the [signing] table in kurogane.toml
```

### Debug bundles

Use `--debug` for development/testing without full optimization:

```bash
kurogane bundle --debug
```

This runs `cargo build` with the `kurogane/debug` feature flag instead of `--release`.

## Output layouts

### Linux directory (`--format dir`)

The directory format is the canonical Linux bundle: a small launcher around the application binary and a flat Chromium runtime.

```
dist/
├── myapp                      # launcher script
├── runtime/
│   ├── myapp                  # actual binary (RUNPATH $ORIGIN/cef)
│   └── cef/                   # flat Chromium runtime
│       ├── libcef.so
│       ├── locales/
│       ├── icudtl.dat
│       ├── chrome-sandbox     # present but inert (see below)
│       └── ...
├── content/                   # frontend (if present)
│   └── index.html
└── assets/                    # extra resources (if present)
```

Users run the launcher:

```bash
./dist/myapp
```

#### Launcher contract

The launcher script does exactly two things:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env sh
set -eu
ROOT="$(CDPATH= cd -- "$(dirname -- "$0")" && pwd)"
cd "$ROOT" # anchors the working directory
exec "$ROOT/runtime/myapp" "$@"
```

> [!NOTE]
> Kurogane does not set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` for normal Linux bundles. Library loading is handled by the executable's RUNPATH.

#### Library loading (RPATH)

Projects created with `kurogane new` get this baked in at link time via `.cargo/config.toml`:

```toml
[target.'cfg(all(unix, not(target_os = "macos")))']
rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=-Wl,-rpath,$ORIGIN/cef"]
```

This covers all Linux targets (x86_64 and aarch64). The loader then finds `libcef.so` in `<exe_dir>/cef` with no environment setup.

For *exotic* environments (e.g. NixOS), there is one opt-in escape hatch, never applied automatically:

```bash
KUROGANE_LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/nix/store/...-lib:/nix/store/... ./dist/myapp
```

#### Sandbox note

Kurogane sets `no_sandbox = 1` on Linux, so `chrome-sandbox` ships as an inert file without setuid bits. If the sandbox policy ever flips, no packaging change is needed, the file is already in place.

### Windows directory (`--format dir`)

```
dist/
├── myapp.exe                  # binary (beside libcef.dll)
├── libcef.dll
├── chrome_elf.dll
├── locales/
├── icudtl.dat
├── v8_context_snapshot.bin
├── content/                   # frontend (if present)
│   └── index.html
└── assets/                    # extra resources (if present)
```

Windows places Chromium beside the executable because the Windows loader searches the executable directory for DLL dependencies automatically.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Keep the Chromium runtime dependencies together.** On Windows, Chromium's runtime DLLs must be discoverable by the Windows loader, typically by placing them alongside the application executable (or on `PATH`).

### Linux AppImage (`--format appimage`)

AppImage wraps the canonical directory bundle rather than rebuilding it.

```
dist/
└── myapp_1.0.0_x86_64.AppImage    # single self-contained file
```

Internal structure (visible via `myapp.AppImage --appimage-extract`):

```
squashfs-root/
├── AppRun                           # thin entry point
├── myapp.desktop                    # deployed to root by linuxdeploy
├── myapp.png                        # deployed to root by linuxdeploy
├── .DirIcon -> myapp.png            # created by linuxdeploy
└── usr/
    ├── lib/myapp/                   # the canonical directory bundle
    │   ├── myapp                    # launcher script
    │   ├── runtime/
    │   │   ├── myapp                # binary (RUNPATH $ORIGIN/cef)
    │   │   └── cef/                 # Chromium runtime
    │   ├── content/                 # frontend (if present)
    │   └── <extra resources>
    ├── share/applications/myapp.desktop
    └── share/icons/hicolor/256x256/apps/myapp.png
```

The canonical bundle is staged **verbatim** at `usr/lib/<name>/`; the exact artifact `--format dir` produces, verified by the same rules. The generated `AppRun` is three lines: resolve the AppDir, exec the bundle's launcher. All loading and working-directory concerns stay inside the bundle.

linuxdeploy contributes the desktop integration (root symlinks for desktop file, icon, `.DirIcon`) and deploys system libraries (nss, glib, atk, ...) that Chromium links against. Two flags keep it from interfering with the bundle:

- `--deploy-deps-only <bundle>`: Resolve dependencies *for* the bundled ELFs without copying, stripping, or re-rpathing them
- `--exclude-library 'libcef*'`: The Chromium runtime can never be re-deployed out of `runtime/cef/`

Without these, linuxdeploy scans every ELF in the AppDir and duplicates the entire Chromium runtime into `usr/lib/`.

#### Desktop file quirk

In a freedesktop desktop entry, `Version=` is the *specification* version, not the application version. Arbitrary values make `desktop-file-validate` (and therefore appimagetool) fail. Kurogane writes `Version=1.0` and records the application version in `X-AppImage-Version=`.

#### Tools

First run downloads **linuxdeploy** (cached in `~/.cache/kurogane/tools/`). Subsequent builds reuse the cache.

#### Running without FUSE

On systems without FUSE (some CI runners, containers, WSL1):

```bash
./myapp_1.0.0_x86_64.AppImage --appimage-extract
./squashfs-root/AppRun
```

This extracts the identical payload and runs the real entry point. Also useful for verifying what an AppImage contains.

### Windows NSIS installer (`--format nsis`)

NSIS treats the verified directory bundle as an opaque payload and installs it wholesale.

```
dist/
├── myapp_1.0.0_x64-setup.exe       # NSIS installer
├── bundle/                          # staged canonical bundle (temporary)
└── installer.nsi                     # generated script (temporary)
```

The installer treats the application as one opaque payload: the verified canonical bundle is copied wholesale into `$INSTDIR` (`File /r "${BUNDLEDIR}\*.*"`). The installer has no opinion about Chromium layout, frontend placement, or resources; whatever the verifier accepted is what gets installed, byte-for-byte.

The installer:
- Installs per-user (default `$LOCALAPPDATA\...`, user-selectable via the directory page)
- Creates Start Menu and Desktop shortcuts pointing at the executable
- Registers in Windows Add/Remove Programs (HKCU) with estimated size
- Ships an uninstaller that removes `$INSTDIR` recursively plus shortcuts and registry keys

## Configuration

Packaging behavior is configured declaratively in `kurogane.toml` at the project root. The file is optional, an absent file (or absent keys) reproduces the historical defaults exactly. Unknown keys are ignored, so older templates keep parsing.

```toml
[app]
# Display name; defaults to the cargo package name
name = "My App"
# Frontend source directory relative to the project root
frontend = "frontend"
# Frontend build output that gets bundled; relative to the project root
frontend-dist = "frontend/dist"
# Command to install frontend dependencies
frontend-install = "npm --prefix frontend install"
# Command to run the frontend dev server
frontend-run = "npm --prefix frontend run dev"
# Command to build the frontend before cargo build
frontend-build = "npm --prefix frontend run build"
publisher = "Example Corp"          # NSIS Manufacturer / Add-Remove Programs Publisher
description = "A demo application"  # NSIS FileDescription
copyright = "(c) 2026 Example Corp" # NSIS LegalCopyright + BrandingText
icon = "assets/icon.png"            # AppImage hicolor icon (PNG)

[[bundle.resources]]
source = "assets/data"              # file or directory, relative to the project root
destination = "share/data"          # optional; bundle-root-relative; defaults to the source file name
preserve-symlinks = false           # optional; recreate symlinks inside a directory (macOS/Linux)

[linux]
categories = ["Development", "IDE"] # .desktop Categories=; default ["Utility"]
terminal = true                     # .desktop Terminal=; default false

[macos]
minimum-system-version = "13.0"     # Info.plist LSMinimumSystemVersion; omitted by default
category = "public.app-category.photography" # LSApplicationCategoryType; default public.app-category.utilities

[windows]
start-menu-shortcut = true          # default true
desktop-shortcut = true             # default true

[signing]
certificate = "certs/codesign.pfx"  # thumbprint (signtool) or cert file (.pfx/.p12 or PEM chain)
timestamp-url = "http://timestamp.digicert.com"
digest-algorithm = "sha256"
custom-command = "signtool sign /fd sha256"  # first token is the program; %1 expands to the target path
```

`frontend` and `frontend-dist` are build-time paths resolved against the project root. At runtime the packaged app serves its frontend from the bundle's fixed `content/` directory, so the scaffolded `src/main.rs` points the release build there:

```rust
#[cfg(not(debug_assertions))]
App::new("content").run_or_exit();
```

Resource destinations are validated before packaging: absolute paths and `..` components are rejected.

`[macos]` values are checked when the file loads: `minimum-system-version` must be a dotted version such as `13.0`, and `category` one of Apple's `public.app-category.*` types.

## Extra resources

Resources declared under `[[bundle.resources]]` are placed inside the canonical bundle in every format:

- Directory format: `dist/<destination>`
- AppImage: `usr/lib/<name>/<destination>` (inside the canonical bundle)
- NSIS: `$INSTDIR\<destination>` (via the wholesale copy)

Entries without a `destination` land at the bundle root under their source file name.

Directories are copied through their symlinks by default, so the bundle holds no links. Set `preserve-symlinks = true` on a directory resource whose layout depends on them, such as a macOS framework (`Versions/Current`) or a PyInstaller build that links its libraries instead of duplicating them. Each link is recreated as is, and only if it is relative, stays inside the resource and points at something that exists; any other link fails the bundle with its path. This is supported on macOS and Linux.

## Code signing

Signing is **off by default**. Pass `--sign` to enable it; all signing parameters come from `[signing]` in `kurogane.toml`. Certificate *references* live in config files, never secrets or passwords.

```bash
kurogane bundle --format nsis --sign
```

If `--sign` is passed but no usable `[signing]` table exists (no `certificate` and no `custom-command`), the command fails with an actionable error.

### What gets signed and when

The pipeline signs PE binaries inside the staged bundle **before** format assembly, so installers embed already-signed files:

| Format | Bundle binaries | Final artifact |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| dir    | signed in place | n/a |
| nsis   | signed while staged | installer `.exe` signed, then verified |
| appimage | no-op on Linux | not signed |

For installer formats, binaries are signed before assembly. The final installer is then signed and verified.

Verification runs after artifact signing via the platform tool (`signtool verify /pa /all`, `osslsigncode verify`).

### Tool selection

On Windows, `signtool.exe` is preferred when available. Otherwise, Kurogane uses `osslsigncode` which is supported on all platforms.

| Tool           | Discovery order                                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `signtool.exe` | `SignConfig.tool`, `KUROGANE_SIGNTOOL_PATH`, then Windows SDK paths |
| `osslsigncode` | `KUROGANE_OSSLSIGNCODE_PATH`, then `PATH`                           |

Only `.exe` and `.dll` files are signed. SHA-256 is the default digest; timestamps use the RFC-3161 `/tr` + `/td` pair (`signtool`) or `-ts` (`osslsigncode`). `osslsigncode` signs into a temporary file that replaces the original only on success, so a failed pass never corrupts the target.

### Certificate material

- **signtool**: set `certificate` to the certificate thumbprint.
- **osslsigncode**: set `certificate` to a PKCS#12 container (`.pfx`/`.p12`, passed via `-pkcs12`) or a PEM/DER cert chain (passed via `-certs`). Passphrases are prompted interactively by the tool.

### Custom signing command

For tools that are not directly supported, use `custom-command`. The `%1` placeholder in arguments is replaced with the target file path:

```toml
[signing]
custom-command = "azuresigntool sign -kvu https://my-vault.vault.azure.net %1"
```

(Whitespace splitting only; use a wrapper script when arguments need quoting.)

## Validation

Validation happens in two stages, using the same runtime checks throughout the packaging pipeline.

### Distribution check (pre-packaging)

[`ResolvedDistribution::validate()`](https://github.com/0x48piraj/kurogane/blob/2caa063cf8cd32352a57f5691417750b2bf3bc2d/kurogane-layout/src/distribution.rs#L78) checks:

- Executable exists and is a file (not a directory)
- Frontend directory exists and contains `index.html` (when present)
- Chromium runtime directory exists
- All extra resources exist

### Runtime check (the gate)

[`validate_cef_runtime()`](https://github.com/0x48piraj/kurogane/blob/2caa063cf8cd32352a57f5691417750b2bf3bc2d/kurogane-layout/src/cef.rs#L463) requires the complete runnable subset:

| Linux | Windows |
|-------|---------|
| `libcef.so` | `libcef.dll` |
| `chrome-sandbox` | `chrome_elf.dll` |
| `icudtl.dat` | `icudtl.dat` |
| `locales/` | `locales/` |
| `v8_context_snapshot.bin` *or* `snapshot_blob.bin` | `v8_context_snapshot.bin` *or* `snapshot_blob.bin` |

(The V8 snapshot filename varies across Chromium versions; either spelling satisfies the check.)

Every format runs this check after materializing: [`package_directory()`](https://github.com/0x48piraj/kurogane/blob/2caa063cf8cd32352a57f5691417750b2bf3bc2d/kurogane-layout/src/package.rs#L21) refuses to emit a bundle with an incomplete runtime. A bundle that exists on disk has passed the gate. There is no "partial Chromium for testing" mode anymore.

## Frontend-less bundles

If your app has no HTML frontend (e.g., pure Rust with IPC), leave `frontend-dist` unset:

```bash
# No frontend-dist/ directory present
kurogane bundle
# Warns: "No frontend/dist/ directory found"
# Bundle proceeds without frontend
```

The bundle will not contain a `content/` directory and [`verify()`](https://github.com/0x48piraj/kurogane/blob/2caa063cf8cd32352a57f5691417750b2bf3bc2d/kurogane-layout/src/distribution.rs#L78) will not require `index.html`.

## Troubleshooting

### No usable Chromium distribution

No managed installation exists for the expected version. Run:

```bash
kurogane install
```

`kurogane doctor` shows the expected version, the expected path and all installed versions.

### "CEF_PATH override has no archive.json" / Unverifiable override

You pointed `CEF_PATH` at a directory without provenance (e.g. a manually extracted or self-built CEF tree). Release bundling requires traceable provenance.

Use `kurogane install`, or point `CEF_PATH` at an official distribution that includes `archive.json`.

### "version mismatch" / "platform mismatch" on CEF_PATH

The override exists but doesn't match the Chromium version this kurogane build links against, or was built for another platform. Check the expected values in the error message; `kurogane doctor` prints them too.

### "missing required file: ..." during packaging

The resolved distribution failed the runtime gate (see above).

Re-run `kurogane install`; if overriding via `CEF_PATH`, ensure you have the complete distribution.

### "NSIS not found" (Windows)

Install NSIS from [nsis.sourceforge.io](https://nsis.sourceforge.io) or set:

```powershell
$env:NSIS_PATH = "C:\Program Files\NSIS\makensis.exe"
```

### "linuxdeploy failed" (Linux)

Read the tool output above the error. Common causes:

- **Icon errors**: The desktop file's `Icon=` must match a file under `usr/share/icons/hicolor/**`. Kurogane installs a placeholder automatically; custom icons should go into the hicolor theme.
- **Desktop file validation**: `Version=` must be a specification version (`1.0`), not your app version.
- **FUSE unavailable**: `linuxdeploy` runs with `APPIMAGE_EXTRACT_AND_RUN=1` internally, but if the environment blocks extraction entirely, run the build on a FUSE-capable host.

To inspect or run a produced AppImage without FUSE, see [Running without FUSE](#running-without-fuse).

### App launches but window is blank / content missing

The launcher sets the working directory to the bundle root, so frontend files must be available under `content/`. If your application loads content by absolute path, prefer `App::new("content")` so the path remains valid when the bundle is relocated, such as from a directory bundle to an AppImage or installed location.
